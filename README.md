# Auto_trader

Auto Trader is one of the largest companies in the UK for selling and buying cars. It is an automotive marketplace which allows sellers and buyers of cars to interact and connect. Users can search for their desired cars based on some specification namely year of registration , car model, price, etc. In this project we mainly focus on building a machine learning model to predict the price of the cars based on some relevent features. With regards to the dataset, we use a sample dataset which is composed of 11 unique features and 402005 observations. The process has been divided into several steps as stated below:

Part 1: Importing Data and Renaming Columns Names
Part 2: Data/Domain Understanding and Exploration
✔ Meaning and Type of Features
✔ Analysis of Distributions
✔ Analysis of Associations, Data Exploration and Visualisation
part 3: Data Processing for Machine Learning
✔ Dealing with Missing Values, Outliers, and Noise
✔ Feature Engineering
Target Encoder
✔ Feature Selection
Correlation Coefficient and Analysis of Predictive Power of Features
Lasso Regression
Mutual Information Regression
part 4: Model Building
✔ Algorithm Selection, Model Instantiation and Configuration, and Model Ranking and Selection
part 5: Coarse-Grained Evaluation/Analysis
part 6: Grid Search and Hyperparameter Tuning
part 7: Model Evaluation and Analysis
✔ Feature Importance and Fine-Grained Evaluation
